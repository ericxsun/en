You can know more about me in the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog site, as its name indicates, is about Machine learning, Data mining, AI, Program and fun. I often update my old posts (even after years) to correct errors and remove outdated information, so please do not take everything for granted.

This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template and homepage was derived from the site [setImpl](http://yihui.name/) by Yihui Xie. (Thanks a lot!). You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.

I like contributing to open source software like:

- [[sina weibo crawler](https://github.com/followyourheart/sina-weibo-crawler)]: I'm the author of a sina weibo crawler
